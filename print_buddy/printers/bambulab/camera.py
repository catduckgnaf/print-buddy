"""Bambu Lab chamber camera: one bounded JPEG snapshot over the LAN (#294).

A1/P1-family printers serve camera stills as a raw JPEG frame stream on TCP
port 6000: the client connects, sends one 80-byte authentication packet (the
user name ``bblp`` and the printer's LAN access code in fixed 32-byte fields),
and the printer then streams frames, each preceded by a 16-byte little-endian
header whose first word is the frame size. The packet and framing are the
protocol behaviour of the maintained clients cited in
docs/BAMBU-CONNECTIVITY.md (pybambu and bambulabs_api, both MIT, at the pinned
commits recorded there); this implementation is written from those protocol
facts, not copied, and — like every Bambu LAN path in Print Buddy — it has
**not been run against a real printer yet**.

X1-family printers serve RTSPS on port 322 instead (``bblp`` / access code,
stream path ``/streaming/live/1`` — the same maintained-client protocol
facts). Print Buddy deliberately grows no RTSP stack for a still image: X1
stills come through the go2rtc fan-out from #246 (the decision recorded on
#294). go2rtc ingests the printer's RTSPS stream as its one configured
camera source and serves a JPEG still of it on its loopback API;
:func:`fanout_snapshot` reads that still, and only when the fan-out is
actually running with this printer's stream as its source — otherwise it
raises a plain error naming exactly what to enable, never a fake success.
Models whose camera protocol is not documented in the research (P2S, H2
family) report ``None`` — unverified is stated, never guessed.

The snapshot contract mirrors the Moonraker path's
``_camera_snapshot_bytes()``: at most 8 MiB, and the bytes must be a JPEG
(``FF D8`` … ``FF D9``). The transport is injectable (``transport_factory``)
so tests run fully offline with fakes, following the MQTT/FTPS factories in
client.py. Error messages never include the access code or any payload bytes:
the code is a secret, and a payload could be anything the network sent back.
