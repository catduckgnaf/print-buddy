"""Channel → printer routing for the standalone bot (#335; shared channels #536).

One bot serves every configured printer. Each roster entry claims one chat
on the platform the bot runs: the entry's own ``chat_id`` when it sets one,
else the platform's home chat (``[discord] chat_id``, ``[telegram] chat_id``
or ``[matrix] room_id``). The claim model:

- A chat claimed by exactly one entry routes to that printer: a message or
  interaction in it is handled for that printer, decided before any
  handler runs.
- A chat claimed by two or more entries is a *shared* channel (#536). It
  is served, but the channel decides nothing: printer-bound handlers ask
  which printer (or resolve the printer from the job they act on), and a
  shared channel never falls through to the default printer.
- A chat nobody claimed is dropped silently, exactly as a foreign channel
  is dropped today; with no roster at all, the legacy single configured
  chat routes to the default printer.
