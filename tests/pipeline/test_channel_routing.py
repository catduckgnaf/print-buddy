"""Two channels, two printers, end to end (#335 acceptance): offline.

Reuses the prepared-intake harness (stubbed slicing; the start goes through
the real print_next.start gates with a stub print-now) and drives
prepare_link once per channel with that channel's printer bound, the way
model_link_dispatch binds it from the routing map. Each job must be stamped
with its own printer, every question and post must land in its own channel,
and each start must target its own job. A flow with no printer bound keeps
the legacy behaviour: the job belongs to the default (first) printer.
