"""The design §3 worked example, load-checked offline (#337 acceptance).

The config below is the MULTI-PRINTER-DESIGN.md section 3 example verbatim:
a Bambu A1 and a Flashforge AD5X in one instance, two Discord channels, one
shared Spoolman. Both entries must resolve, the channels must bind to the
right printers, Spoolman must be the same service for both, and each
printer's state must live in its own folder.

# families, the per-printer suites pair state and leases, and routing
# pairs channels. These pin the combinations that can cross-contaminate
# when three different listener families share one instance, one
# Spoolman and one fallback channel — and the claimless entry, which
# must stay unreachable by chat without breaking the others' routing.
